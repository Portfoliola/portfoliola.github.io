        My name is Erika Himsl, and I am an artist from Nova Scotia.<br><br>
          From an early age, storybooks and animation captured my imagination, inspiring me to bring ideas of my own to paper. I 
          sold my first artwork at 12, and by my teens, began sketching portraits for people and their pets. Experimenting with
        acrylic paints during this time opened up my work to a whole new world of colour.<br><br>
        Since then, I've continued to create with traditional and digital media, with a special interest in children's illustration
        and storytelling.</p>
